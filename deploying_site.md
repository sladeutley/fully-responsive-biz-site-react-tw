First, if deploying to netlify, go to youtube tutorial 'process-notes' file for important note about adding '_redirects' file before running 'npm run build'

1. create optimized production build -
  a. in terminal in main project folder, type 'npm run build'
2. click on newly created dist folder, and then click 'Reveal in File Explorer'
3. For tutorial on how to do this on hostinger, watch beginning of his tutorial (around 3:42 to 8:15) then continue at around 2:14:20 mark, but for me, I'm going to follow my instructions to deploy on netlify from my youtube clone project. *Note, instead of dropping 'build' folder into netlify, you will drop 'dist' folder
